In this experiment you will be asked to click on objects according to a set of spoken instructions.  On each trial, four objects will be shown on the screen.  
You will then hear a spoken instruction asking you to click on one of the objects. 
The instructions were recorded by an individual who was presented with the same set of objects that you will see. 
He was asked to give instructions that would direct a listener to select the correct object.  
The study is intended to measure how effectively people communicate in various situations.  
In order to evaluate how well the speaker conveyed the intended meaning, it is important for you to respond as accurately and quickly as you can.
